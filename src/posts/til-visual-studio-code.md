## Visual Studio Code TIL

My go-to code editor has been Visual Studio Code for the last couple of years. I’ve set it up from scratch the previous week for a new project. 

As the project is more closed than most of my customer projects, I use the Foam system as my note-keeping system. 

> **Foam** is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), built on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

> You can use **Foam** for organising your research, keeping re-discoverable notes, writing long-form content and, optionally, publishing it to the web.

Today I encountered two different issues with Visual Studio Code that I needed to fix.

### Bouncing Ghost Visual Studio Code

The first issue I encountered was  caused by a spellright plugin [Two icons in the Dock (macOS) · Issue #138838 · microsoft/vscode · GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/138838#issuecomment-991354259)

### Setting ’Code’ to Path Resets After Restart

This one was my own doing. [I’ve just forgotten to move the application to the Applications folder](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51390852).
