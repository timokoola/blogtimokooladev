**Rowan sat under a tree exhausted. The fight with the dragon only** made him more weary. He could barely open his eyes.

Suddenly he heard a rustling in the bushes. He leapt to his feet and drew his sword, preparing for another battle. **But it was just** a small rabbit.

He let out a sigh of relief and sheathed his sword. He wanted nothing more than to lay down and rest, but he knew he had to keep moving. He had to find the others and warn them about the dragon. **Even if it was mortally wounded** it could still pose a threat.

He forced himself to stand up and started walking, but he could barely put one foot in front of the other. He felt like he was going to collapse at any moment.

Suddenly, he heard the sound of wings flapping. He turned around and saw the dragon, flying towards him, its mouth open wide, ready to devour him. **Dragon hissed** in pain and anger.

Rowan tried to run, but he was so weary that he could barely move. The dragon was upon him in an instant. It snatched him up in its teeth and started to fly away.

Rowan knew that he was going to die. There was no escape from the dragon's clutches. He just hoped that his death would be quick and painless. **But all of a sudden**, he felt himself falling.

The dragon had been shot by an arrow and it was dropping him from its mouth. He hit the ground hard, but he was still alive. He looked up and saw the dragon flying away, an arrow lodged in its side.

Someone had saved him. He didn't know who it was, but he was grateful. He was too tired to move, so he just lay there, hoping that someone would come and find him. **And then he passed out.**

**He slowly came to** and found himself in a strange place. He was in a huge cavernous room with a high ceiling. Dozens of people were milling around and there was a fire burning in a pit in the center of the room.

He tried to get up, but he was still weak from his ordeal. Someone came over to him and helped him sit up.

"Are you alright?" the man asked.

"I think so," Rowan said. "What is this place?"

"This is the dragons' lair," the man replied. "You were lucky that we found you when we did. The dragon would have eaten you if we hadn't killed it."

Rowan was shocked. He had been in the dragon's lair all along. He was surrounded by the people who had killed the dragon. He should have been scared, but he wasn't. He felt safe with these people.

"Thank you for saving me," he said.

"Don't thank us," the man said. "Thank her."

He pointed to a woman across the room. She was standing in front of the fire, her back to them. Rowan couldn't see her face, but he knew who she was. He had seen her before, in his dreams.

"The Dragon Slayer," he whispered.

"Yes," the man said. "Her name is Sarah."

Rowan felt a sense of awe as he looked at her. She was the one who had saved him. She was the one who had killed the dragon.

He wanted to talk to her, to thank her, but he was too afraid. He didn't know what to say. So he just watched her from across the room, wondering who this mysterious woman was.

**Next morning**, Rowan was taken to meet Sarah. She was just as he had seen her in his dreams. She was beautiful, but there was something else about her that he couldn't quite put his finger on.

"Thank you for saving me," he said.

"You're welcome," she replied. "But I didn't do it for you. I did it for the dragon."

"The dragon?" Rowan was confused. "Why would you want to save it?"

"Dragons are misunderstood creatures," she explained. "They're not all evil. Some of them are actually quite gentle."

"But this dragon was different," Rowan said. "It was going to kill me."

"I know," Sarah said. "But I couldn't just stand by and watch it happen. I had to do something."

Rowan looked at her in wonder. He had never met anyone like her before. She was brave and selfless and he knew that he would never forget her.

**Rowan spent a week in the camp and** then he set off on his own again. But this time he wasn't alone. He had made a new friend, one who would always be there for him, even when he was dreaming.

**Chapter 2 - Capital**

**Rowan was standing of the deck**
of a ship, looking out at the vast ocean. It was a beautiful day and the sun was shining. He was on his way home, back to his home country after being away for many years.

He was excited to see his family again and to finally be home. But he was also nervous. He had changed so much in the years that he was away. He wasn't sure if his family would even recognize him.

As the ship approached the shore, he could see the capital city in the distance. It was just as he remembered it. The city was bustling with people and there was a feeling of excitement in the air.

He disembarked the ship and made his way through the streets. He was surprised at how much the city had changed. There were new buildings and new faces. But he soon found his way to his old home.

He knocked on the door and waited. He heard footsteps inside and then the door opened. His mother was standing there, looking at him with surprise.

"Rowan?" she said, disbelief in her voice.

"Yes, it's me," he replied.

She pulled him into a hug and he could feel her shaking.

"I thought you were dead," she said.

"I'm sorry," he replied. "I should have written to you."

"It's okay," she said,pulling away from him. "I'm just glad you're home."

Rowan looked around the house and saw that it was exactly the same as he remembered it. Nothing had changed. It was like he had never left.

"Where's Father?" he asked.

"He's out," she replied. "He'll be back soon."

"I'll go and find him," Rowan said.

He left the house and made his way through the streets. He was surprised at how many people he recognized. He had been away for so long, but it seemed like nothing had changed.

He soon found his father's workshop. It was a small building, but it was always full of people. His father was a blacksmith and he was very good at his job.

Rowan walked in and saw his father working at the forge. He walked up to him and tapped him on the shoulder. His father turned around and looked at him in disbelief.

"Rowan?" he said.

"Yes, it's me," Rowan replied.

His father pulled him into a hug and patted him on the back.

"I thought you were dead," he said.

"I'm sorry," Rowan replied. "I should have written to you."

"It's okay," his father said,pulling away from him. "I'm just glad you're home."

"I've missed you," Rowan said.

"I've missed you too, son," his father replied.

"I'm sorry I didn't write," Rowan said. "I was just so busy."

"It's okay," his father said. "I understand. I'm just glad you're home."

Rowan stayed with his family for a few weeks and then he decided it was time to move on. He had seen all he needed to see in the capital and he was ready for a new adventure.

He said goodbye to his family and set off into the unknown. He had no idea where he was going, but he was excited to find out. He was finally living the life he always wanted to live. And he was going to make the most of it.
