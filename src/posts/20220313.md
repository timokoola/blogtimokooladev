Lately, I've been thinking what custom items I want to add to this blog (+ the [My language learning blog](https://kolmesanaa.link)) and been kicking tyres of [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) which according to its own documentation is:

> Stencil is a toolchain for building reusable, scalable Design Systems. Generate small, blazing fast, and 100% standards based Web Components that run in every browser.

I pick it for two reasons:

1. I can build custom web components using Typescript and other modern tools...
2. ..., but I still can deliver it as a single blob of text, even just embed it in a static web page.

Stencil gets to do this because of the build step and the "just javascript" build target.

I am planning to write about the process here in following weeks. With at least following topics:

1. Creating a very basic component
2. Creating tests for that very basic component
3. Building the said component using Github Actions
4. Styling the component
