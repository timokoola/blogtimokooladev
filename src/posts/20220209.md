I've been slowly tweaking the site and I am almost ready to start writing in proper. Today, I fixed following things:

* Missing meta tag
* Dark mode text colour
* Color of the link in footer

After today, all main styling is done and [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) tests all pass with 100/100/100/100.

Things still to-do:
* To write the about page (I need to update about pages of all my blogs now see [Three Words](https://kolmesanaa.link/) and [Timo Koola](https://blog.timokoola.com/))
* Company info page
* Systematic checking of the styles on the page

And after that: writing...
