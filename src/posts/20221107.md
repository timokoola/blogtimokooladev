Yesterday and today I've read about the history of story generators. One particularly good summary of the history of these algorithms is [Story Generator Algorithms | the living handbook of narratology](https://www-archiv.fdm.uni-hamburg.de/lhn/node/35.html). Here I lifted some ideas to try. My basic model will be this:

- Generate characters for the story, both the main charaters. Figure out attributes and how it affects the dynamic between characters
- Generate terrain and weather. While I hope I would have time to generate full on world with varying terrains, I think will just pick some existing world and draw a some kind of route on it and pick chapter scenery from that. Same goes for weather, I will pick weather that fits the timeline of the story. Relatively easy way would be to start from Spring and end somewhere in late Autumn
- Generate high level chapter elements e.g. conflict, location, weather, encounters for the book
- For each chapter generate more detailed arc e.g setup, conflict, after math, dialogue, update the world and character state (I am thinking this as a RPG campaign of sorts)
- Come up with some scoring system for a story (generate a bunch of them and pick the most 'exciting' story based on the score)

When this kind of chapter generator is done, finalize the text with GPT-3.
