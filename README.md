# Timokoola.dev

This site was initialized using the neat starter [https://neat-starter.netlify.app/](https://neat-starter.netlify.app/) but I ended up a slightly different tech stack.

### Technologies used:

- [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)
- [Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets](https://sass-lang.com/)
